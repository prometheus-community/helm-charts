                                          A node selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator
                                          that relates the key and values.

                            Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                            If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                            Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                            Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                            tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                            it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                            negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                              MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                              When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                              between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                              The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                              or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                              labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                              In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                              |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                              - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                              scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                              violate MaxSkew(1).
                              - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                              When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                              to topologies that satisfy it.

                              MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                              When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                              Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                              And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                              this value has no effect on scheduling.
                              As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                              scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                              If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                              Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                              When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.


                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                              labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                              |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                              The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                              In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                              because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                              it will violate MaxSkew.

                              "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                              labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                              | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                              If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                              to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                              MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                              won't make it *more* imbalanced.
