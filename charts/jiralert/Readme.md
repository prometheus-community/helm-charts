# jiralert

JIRAlert implements Alertmanager's webhook HTTP API and connects to one or more Jira instances to create highly configurable Jira issues.

**Homepage:** <https://github.com/prometheus-community/jiralert>

## Usage

The chart is distributed as an [OCI Artifact](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/) as well as via a traditional [Helm Repository](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/).

- OCI Artifact: `oci://ghcr.io/prometheus-community/charts/jiralert`
- Helm Repository: `https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts` with chart `jiralert`

The installation instructions use the OCI registry. Refer to the [`helm repo`]([`helm repo`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo/)) command documentation for information on installing charts via the traditional repository.

### Install Chart

```console
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] oci://ghcr.io/prometheus-community/charts/jiralert
```

_See [configuration](#configuration) below._

_See [`helm install`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) for command documentation._

### Uninstall Chart

```console
helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME]
```

This removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

_See [`helm uninstall`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for command documentation._

### Upgrading Chart

```console
helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] [CHART] --install
```

_See [`helm upgrade`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/) for command documentation._

## Configuration
