                    Result type defines which data is returned from the generator.
                    By default it is the "data" section of the Vault API response.
                    When using e.g. /auth/token/create the "data" section is empty but
                    the "auth" section contains the generated token.
                    Please refer to the vault docs regarding the result data structure.
