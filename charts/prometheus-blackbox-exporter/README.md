  For the old behavior, set `image.registry` to an empty string and only use `image.repository`.

### To 7.0.0

This version introduces the `securityContext` and `podSecurityContext` and removes `allowICMP`option.

All previous values are setup as default. In case that you want to enable previous functionality for `allowICMP` you need to explicit enabled with the following configuration:

```yaml
securityContext:
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    add: ["NET_RAW"]
```

All values in the list `additionalRelabeling` will now appear under `relabelings` instead of `metricRelabelings`.

This version removes Helm 2 support. Also the ingress config has changed, so you have to adapt to the example in the values.yaml.

### To 4.0.0

### To 2.0.0

This version removes the `podDisruptionBudget.enabled` parameter and changes the default value of `podDisruptionBudget` to `{}`, in order to fix Helm 3 compatibility.

In order to upgrade, please remove `podDisruptionBudget.enabled` from your custom values.yaml file and set the content of `podDisruptionBudget`, for example:

```yaml
podDisruptionBudget:
  maxUnavailable: 0
```

### To 1.0.0

This version introduce the new recommended labels.

In order to upgrade, delete the Deployment before upgrading:

```bash
kubectl delete deployment [RELEASE_NAME]-prometheus-blackbox-exporter
```

Note that this will cause downtime of the blackbox.
