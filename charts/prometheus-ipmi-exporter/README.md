# Prometheus IPMI Exporter

A Prometheus exporter for *IP Management Interface* metrics.

This chart creates a [IPMI Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/ipmi_exporter) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.33+

## Usage

The chart is distributed as an [OCI Artifact](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/) as well as via a traditional [Helm Repository](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/).

- OCI Artifact: `oci://ghcr.io/prometheus-community/charts/prometheus-ipmi-exporter`
- Helm Repository: `https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts` with chart `prometheus-ipmi-exporter`

The installation instructions use the OCI registry. Refer to the [`helm repo`]([`helm repo`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo/)) command documentation for information on installing charts via the traditional repository.
