| additionalArgs | list | `[]` | Additional arguments to be added to the operator's args list. |
| additionalEnv | list | `[]` | Array containing extra environment variables which can be templated. For example:  - name: RELEASE_NAME    value: "{{ .Release.Name }}"  - name: MY_VAR    value: "mySpecialKey" |
| affinity | object | `{}` | Affinity for the operator to be installed. |
| commonAnnotations | object | `{}` | Annotations to be added to all other resources. |
| config.clusterWide | bool | `true` | This option determines if the operator is responsible for observing events across the entire Kubernetes cluster or if its focus should be narrowed down to the specific namespace within which it has been deployed. |
| config.create | bool | `true` | Specifies whether the secret should be created. |
| config.data | object | `{}` | The content of the configmap/secret, see https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/operator_conf/#available-options for all the available options. |
| config.maxConcurrentReconciles | int | `10` | The maximum number of concurrent reconciles. Defaults to 10. |
| config.name | string | `"cnpg-controller-manager-config"` | The name of the configmap/secret to use. |
| config.secret | bool | `false` | Specifies whether it should be stored in a secret, instead of a configmap. |
